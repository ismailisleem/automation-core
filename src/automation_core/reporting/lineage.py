"""Test-content lineage: group and compare runs by *what they tested*.

A run's identity is the set of fully-qualified test ids it executed — not a
manual "system" label and not the framework repo name. Two runs belong to the
same *lineage* when their test sets overlap enough (see :func:`same_lineage`),
so a run's trend is built only from prior runs of the *same* tests and
comparisons stay apples-to-apples.

Everything here is pure and deterministic so it can be unit-tested with
fixtures before any UI exists. The fully-qualified id is an internal matching
key; user-facing surfaces show friendly names and the plain-language diff from
:func:`diff_tests`, never the raw id.

Design decisions (see ``docs/lineage-model.md``):
- Matching uses the **containment coefficient** ``|A∩B| / min(|A|,|B|)`` with a
  default threshold of ``0.6``. Containment (not Jaccard) means a small smoke
  run that is a subset of a full run counts as the same lineage automatically.
- Lineages are assigned chronologically; each run matches against the
  *most-recent* run of existing lineages (no transitive chaining).
- ``pairwise_delta`` compares over the exact **intersection**; ``trend_series``
  plots each run's raw pass rate restricted to its lineage plus a coverage
  badge (a deliberate v1 simplification — see the doc's backlog).
